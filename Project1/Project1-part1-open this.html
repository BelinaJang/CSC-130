	<p>Personal budgeting app</p>

	<h2>5. How do you plan to use XR emotionally to immerse the user in the experience?</h2>
	<p>Does not use XR</p> 
	
	<h2>6. List 3 reasons why this idea is not good for XR.</h2>
	<p> My idea is not for XR because</p>
	<p>1. Budgeting is about giving the users insights about their current and future spending and saving so high tech graphics or experience are not necessary.</p>
	<p>2. XR is not accessible to everyone so XR will reduce the accessibility </p>
	<p>3. XR adds unnecessary </p>
	<h2>7. List 3 reasons why this idea is not better in 3D.</h2>
	<p>1. Graphs and images necessary for budgeting does not require higher dimensional illustrations.</p>
	<p>2. This app is not much about fancy graphics</p>

		<li>Does your idea exist in 3D?: Not really</li>
		<li>What could you do in your project in 3D that you can't do in 2D?: I can include some 3D illutrations</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h2>10. Add some of these design principles to your hypothesis (page 88)</h2>
	<p>
	<ul>
